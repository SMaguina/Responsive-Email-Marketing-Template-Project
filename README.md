Custom email marketing template projects and course work

I went through a course on creating responsive HTML email to become aware of the modern front-end architecture involved in hand-coding an email template from scratch. The problem was to create a unique email template that is supported across as many possible major browsers, email clients, and devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile). Below are a few of the action steps I did along the way:

* Coded the media queries, tables, and in-line styling required.
* I was provided Photoshop smart object files to slice and bulk export as original graphics. The high definition graphics (ending with file extensions ***2x***) were created as well by doubling the number of pixels in those graphics. 
* Implement HTML5 video into the video with appropriate breakpoints for medium and small screen sizes.
* Validation of HTML code using [W3C's Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Use Litmus to determine compatibility across different browsers and email clients

Using the free version of [Litmus](https://litmus.com), I was able to pass compatibility tests across the 3 email clients offered - Outlook 2013, Gmail(Chrome), and iPhone 6s. The fundamental lesson I learned from this project is that if email clients do not support certain design features or elements, it is important that it does not sacrifice the designâ€™s overall integrity. The more simple the email design, the more likely the email will render properly in the most number of email clients.

I also learned that there are certain limitations around HTML emails, such as that the layouts will not always be pixel-perfect in all email clients. So, from a marketing standpoint, it is best to prioritize what the most important email clients need to be supported by the email campaign sent.
